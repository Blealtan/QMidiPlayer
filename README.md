# QMidiPlayer
A cross-platform midi file player based on libfluidsynth and Qt.

Playground branch for visualization development.

Currently the visualization is a standalone application (based on the old CLI midi player code).

Requires the latest "dumb" version of SMELT. The core of SMELT must be compiled with "make dumb".

You will have to modify the paths in the makefile to make it work...
